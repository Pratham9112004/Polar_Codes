# Polar_Codes
This project investigates Polar Codes, a groundbreaking channel coding technique that achieves Shannonâ€™s capacity for binary-input symmetric channels. Polar Codes are at the core of modern communication systems such as 5G, making them highly relevant for research and industry applications.

ðŸ“Œ Key Features
Encoding/Decoding using channel polarization and transformation matrices.
BPSK Modulation and simulation over AWGN channels.
Successive Cancellation (SC) and Successive Cancellation List (SCL) decoding implemented.
LLR-based optimization to improve decoding accuracy under noisy environments.
Performance validation through BER/SNR analysis and visual plots for N = 128, 256, 512, 1024.
